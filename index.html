        A banknote or bank note[1] – also called a bill (North American English) or simply a note – is a type of paper
        money that is made and distributed ("issued") by a bank of issue, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes
        were originally issued by commercial banks, which were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender
        (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial
        banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank.[2] Commercial banknotes have
        primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks or monetary authorities.

        By extension, the word "banknote" is sometimes used (including by collectors) to refer more generally to paper
        money, but in a strict sense notes that have not been issued by banks, e.g. government notes, are not
        banknotes.[3][better source needed]

        National banknotes are often, but not always, legal tender, meaning that courts of law are required to recognize
        them as satisfactory payment of money debts.[4] Historically, banks sought to ensure that they could always pay
        customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of "backing" notes with something of
        substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver. Today, most
        national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat. With the
        exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued monetary
        units, while banknotes are used for higher values.

        Today, a central bank or treasury is generally solely responsible within a state or currency union for the issue
        of banknotes. However, this is not always the case, and historically, private banks frequently handled all of a
        country's paper currency. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given
        country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes before there was a national
        currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these
        series, the issuing bank would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and
        cashier on a preprinted note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from
        Federal Reserve Notes.

     Until recently, most banknotes were made from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90 grams per square meter. The
    cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from
    ordinary paper: it is much more resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a paper banknote is two
    years),[9] and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet
    light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead
    of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata
    (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper[10] (a kind of Washi).

    <p>
        In the two special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China, arrangements are similar to those
        in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue Hong Kong dollar notes,[6] and in Macau,
        banknotes of the Macanese pataca are issued by two different commercial banks. In Luxembourg, the Banque
        Internationale à Luxembourg was entitled to issue its own Luxembourgish franc notes until the introduction of
        the Euro in 1999.[7]
